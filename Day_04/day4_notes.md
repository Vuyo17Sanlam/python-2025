## control flow

- Decision Tree
  'if_else'
  'if_elif_else'
  Loops

1. while
2. for

Purpose: simply repeating statements

```py
print("vote for Jevani")
print("vote for Jevani")
print("vote for Jevani")
```

### while

![alt text](image-3.png)

```py
# print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
# print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
# print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")


# Refactor in while loop

# i = 1

# while i <= 3:
#     print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
#     i = i + 1

# print("Voting Ended ðŸŽŠ")


# Refactor in for loop
# for and range (pair)

# range always starts with 0
# range excludes the end

# range(start, end, step)
# range(3) -> range(end)
# for i in range(3):
#     print(i)


# range(start, end) -> range(start, end)
# for and range takes care of incrementing `i`
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

## intro to Git

1. git init
2. Stage all
3. Provide message - why? > What?
4. When to commit
   1. commit at least 3 times in an hour.
   2. Logicical commit - complete commit (No bugs)
   3. small commit - DOn't commit > 10 files
5. Sync to github( Online)

> General rule of thumb for biginners is to commit 3 times in an hour .
