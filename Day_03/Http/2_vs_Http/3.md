# HTTP/2 VS HTTP/3

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are both newer versions of the HTTP protocol, designed to make websites load faster and more securely. However, they work in different ways.

> ### HTTP/2

- HTTP/2 uses **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) to send data.
- It allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time, but of one packet is lost, everything slows down because TCP waits for it be resent.
- It also takes extra time to set up a secure connection because it needs two handshakes - one for TCP and another for encryption (**TLS**).

> ### HTTP/3

- Http/3 uses QUIC, which is built on UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- This helps fix the delay issue in HTTP/2 by allowing packets to be handled separatley without stopping everything else.
- HTTP/3 also has encryption built in, making connections faster and more secure

> Example
>
> Imagine you are ordering food from a restaurant online:
>
> - With HTTP/2 (TCP): You place an order for a burger, fries, and a drink. The restaurant prepares all three items together. If the fries take longer to cook, you must wait for everything before getting your order.
>
> - With HTTP/3 (QUIC): The burger, fries, and drink are prepared separately. If the fries take longer, you can still get your burger and drink first, without waiting.
